        <h2>Hi, I'm Toprak!</h2>
        <p>I'm 15 years old and currently in high school. Ever since I was 9, I've had a strong passion for coding and technology. What started as a curiosity has grown into a love for building interactive projects, solving problems, and exploring new ways to make things work.</p>
        
        <p>Over the years, I've created several games and websites, and I'm always working on new ideas and improving my skills. Some of the projects I'm most proud of include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://toprakg.github.io/qalculator" target="_blank">Qalculator</a> - A calculator with a fun, interactive twist.</li>
            <li><a href="https://toprakg.github.io/typamelody" target="_blank">Typamelody</a> - A game that challenges you to type faster to the rhythm of music.</li>
            <li>NationalityGuessr - A game where you guess the nationality of various people.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My coding journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I love sharing my projects with others. Whether it's solving a bug or creating a new feature, there's always something exciting to learn and improve.</p>

        <p>I look forward to the future and can't wait to continue creating and learning more in the world of programming. Thanks for visiting my page!</p>
